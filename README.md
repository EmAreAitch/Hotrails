# Quote Editor using Hotwired Rails

Here I built an quote editor that support adding list of items as per dates that helps one for management of their finances

I built this following the [Hotrails.dev](https://www.hotrails.dev/) a great tutorial for practicing and learning Hotwired.

It really helped me to get a practical understanding of Turbo.
